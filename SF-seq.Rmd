## SF-seq read quality score distributions

In this assignment I worked with the following read files from `/projects/bgmp/2017_sequencing/demultiplexed`: 

```
2_2B_control_S2_L008_R1_001.fastq.gz
2_2B_control_S2_L008_R2_001.fastq.gz
29_4E_fox_S21_L008_R1_001.fastq.gz
29_4E_fox_S21_L008_R2_001.fastq.gz
```


To determine quality score distributions for each read the program FastQC was loaded on talapas along with it's dependencies: 
`ml easybuild intel/2017a FastQC`


In a working directory called SF-seq, a new directory was created for the output of FastQC. FastQC was then run using the following options on all four files. 

```
$ fastqc --noextract -o fastqc_out -t 4 \
2_2B_control_S2_L008_R1_001.fastq.gz 2_2B_control_S2_L008_R2_001.fastq.gz \
29_4E_fox_S21_L008_R1_001.fastq.gz 29_4E_fox_S21_L008_R2_001.fastq.gz
```
